- B.A., Economics, Digital Marketing & Analytics | University of Connecticut (_May 2024_)

## Experience
**Student Consultant @ DREAM Venture Labs, The Build Fellowship
- Build and present a forecasting model for real-world data using Python and statistical methods
- Explore time series decomposition, trend analysis, and predictive modeling to inform client recommendations
- Collaborate with a cohort of consultants to analyze trends and deliver a portfolio-ready solution within 8 weeks

**Graduate Researcher @ Health Informatics Research Laboratory, Boston University
- Analyze 1M+ delivery-related hospital records from the Truven Health MarketScan Database (2006-2020) using Python to assess the clinical and economic impact of pregestational diabetes
- Classify patients across 30+ demographic cohorts using ICD-9/ICD-10 codes to identify elevated risks of preeclampsia and high birth weight in diabetic pregnancies
- Adjust inpatient cost data for inflation using GDP deflator to compute Real Gross Cost (RGC), revealing a consistent annual cost gap of around $4,000 between the groups with diabetes and without diabetes
- Visualize trends in diagnoses, cost, and length of stay, and validate cost disparities with statistical testing, finding that patients with pregestational diabetes had significantly longer hospital stays
- Summarize findings in 15-page paper detailing scientific rationale, methods, results, and relevant conclusions

**Undergraduate Research Assistant @ Systematic Health Action Research Program (SHARP Lab), UConn
- Collaborated with a team of 4 to extract and code data for 300+ studies on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, developing standardized coding frameworks and classification criteria, improving statistical evaluation efficiency
- Implemented advanced data cleaning, preprocessing, and management techniques in R, ensuring data consistency and reliability, which enabled seamless statistical modeling and meta-analysis, increasing data processing speed
- Co-authored a preprint presenting systematic methods and code for empirically estimating pre-post correlations in repeated measures designs, addressing common gaps in meta-analytic studies
- [Extracting Pre-Post Correlations for Meta-Analyses of Repeated Measures Designs] (10.17605/OSF.IO/HZJ4D)
